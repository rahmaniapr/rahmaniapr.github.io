<h1>Let me introduce my self yaaa...</h1>
<p>My name is Rahmania Putri Ramadhani, i'm 16 years old. actually i really don't know what to make a website about. 
    So I guess i will use this final projet as a biography or anything related to me, okay? </p>

So, as you can see my name is Rahmania Putri and you can call me nia. Now i lived in Jakarta and this year i'm 16 years old. 
Sorry for my basic introduce because actually i don't know what should i do for my website. So i will tell you a little bit about my self.
I born in Jakarta, 21 October 2005

<h2>So I have some hobbies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Readinng a book</li>
    <li>Bike</li>
    <li>Scroll my social media account</li>
    <li>And last but not least lying on my bed</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanna tell you about my childhood, I was born from simple family. 
    I was raised with a child who is a little spoiled but now, I realized that i'm not too spoiled because maybe 
    the age factor makes me more independent. Now, I'm in high school and majoring in science. For college 
    i think i'll take dentistry or chemical engineering

</p>
<p>To know more about me, you can go to my Instagram @rahmaniapr.
    </p>
<p>Okey,it's time for you to know that I once participated in a scouting competition, the first competition I participated in, a competition 
at 28 Jakarta Junior high school. There I sat in seventh grade. Yes, like scout competitions in general, I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the 
competition and of course I was happy to be able to participate as partisipant there. Time goes by fast and of course there are many more 
challenging races for me to take part in. That is when I competed in Subang, Bandung. The competition was very fun with lots of fun material to be used
as a competition and Alhamdulillah my team on the first place. I think that was a fun experience for the rest of my life. I really greatful that
I could be in that experience</p>
<p>I don't know this part would be the last part of my website, but I guess yes. So, Thank You for joining and read my website. And wanna say 
thank you for the 5 days filled with material which is certainly very interisting. And also thanks to the Mentor and also TA who always teach in a
different way every day. </p>
<p>Okey, so this will be the last greeting, Thank you guys and see you when there is a chance to meet again!</p>
